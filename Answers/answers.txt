Q2)
    I'm not sure how to make a proper predictions on the latency or bandwidth. However Im sure that the
    Latency will be affect much greater than the Bandwith. Latency Will be affected because it will
    upheld by every delay on its way. From H1 to H4. Counting the delay from h1 to h4 it the latency should
     be 80. My Guess was correct 

Q3)
    I Still dont how to make a proper predictions, However im postive that during this experiment the
    Bandwith will be affected because more flowing is traveling throgh the same port at the same time causeing 
    congesting. The Bandwidth should he slow down

Q4)
    the Latency for h1 to h4 should be at best = 80ms
    the Latency for h5 to h6 should be at best = 20ms
